/**
 * <p>A "system" is a function that runs on all entities with specific {@link Components}.</p>
 * <p>The systems listed here are built-in to splat and should not be called directly in your game.</p>
 * <p>Instead these systems are included in [systems.json]{@link https://github.com/SplatJS/splat-ecs-starter-project/blob/master/src/data/systems.json} in your project.</p>
 * <p>When you write your own systems they will also be included in your project's <code>systems.json</code> file.
